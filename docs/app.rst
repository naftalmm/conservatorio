Swiss army knife for interacting with the STEEM blockchain.

Quickstart
##########

You can start using piston by going throug out Steem hosted quickstart
guide. Just run::

    piston read @xeroc/piston-cli-quickstart

Available Commands
##################

Adding keys (for posting)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Piston comes with its own encrypted wallet to which keys need to be
added:::

    piston addkey <posting-wif-key>

On first run, you will be asked to provide a new passphrase that you
will need to provide every time you want to post on the Steem network.
If you chose an *empty* password, your keys will be stored in plain text
which allows automated posting but exposes your private key to your
local user.

List available Keys and accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can list the installed keys using:::

    piston listkeys

This command will give the list of public keys to which the private keys
are available.::

    piston listaccounts

This command tries to resolve the public keys into account names
registered on the network (experimental).

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``piston`` comes with its owne configuration:::

    piston set default_voter <account-name>
    piston set default_author <account-name>

All configuration variables are provided with ``piston set --help``
You can see your local configuration by calling::

    piston config

Listing
~~~~~~~

``piston`` can list, sort, and filter for posts on the STEEM blockchain.
You can read about the parameters by::

    piston list --help

Example:::

     This is great work xeroc!  Thanks for supporting steem!

Categories
~~~~~~~~~~

Existing categories can be listed via:::

    piston categories --limit 10

Please see the corresponding help page for further options:::

    piston categories --help

Posting
~~~~~~~

To post new content, you need to provide

-  the author,
-  a permlink, and
-  a title

For posting the "posting-key" of the author needs to be added to the
wallet.

Additionally, a ``--category`` can be added as well.::

    echo "Texts" | piston post --author "<author>" --category "<category>" --title "<posttitle>" --permlink "<permlink>"
    cat filename | piston post --author "<author>" --category "<category>" --title "<posttitle>" --permlink "<permlink>"

If you want to provide mulitple tags to your post, you can add it to the
frontmatter like this:::

   ---
   author: ......
   category: .......
   title: .......
   tags:
     - introduceyourself
     - steemonsteroids
     - art
   ---

Replying
~~~~~~~~

Here, the same parameters as for simply posting new content are
available except that instead of ``--category`` a ``replyto`` has to be
provided to identify the post that you want the reply to be posted to.
The ``replyto`` parameter takes the following form:::

    @author/permlink

E.g:::

    echo "Texts" | piston reply --file - "@xeroc/python-steem-0.1.1" --author "<author>"
    cat filename | piston reply --file - "@xeroc/python-steem-0.1.1" --author "<author>"

If you want to use your favorit ``EDITOR``, you can do this by:::

    piston reply "@xeroc/python-steem-0.1.1"

Editing
~~~~~~~

With piston, you can edit your own posts with your favorite text editor
(as defined in the environmental variable ``EDITOR``):::

    $ piston "@xeroc/edit-test" 
    $ EDITOR="nano" piston "@xeroc/edit-test" 

If you want to replace your entire post and not *patch* it, you can add
the ``--replace`` flag.

Voting
~~~~~~

With ``piston``, you can up-/downvote any post with your installed
accounts:::

    piston upvote --voter <voter> <identifier>
    piston downvote --voter <voter> <identifier>

providing the post *identifier*. The identifier takes the form::

    @author/permlink

You can further define the weight (default 100%) manually with
``--weight``.

Replies
~~~~~~~

``piston`` can show replies to posts made by any author:::

    piston replies --author xeroc

If ``--author`` is not provided, the *default* author as defined with
``piston set author`` will be taken. Further options are: ``--limit``.

Transfer Steem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STEEM can be transfered via::

    piston transfer receipient "100.000 GOLOS"

If ``--author`` is not provided, the *default* account as defined with
``piston set author`` will be taken.

Buy/Sell STEEM/SBD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can of course sell your assets in the internal decentralized exchange that
is integrated into the STEEM blockchain by using:::

    piston buy <amount> STEEM <price in SBD per STEEM>
    piston buy <amount> SBD <price in SBD per STEEM>

    piston sell <amount> STEEM <price in SBD per STEEM>
    piston sell <amount> SBD <price in SBD per STEEM>

Powerup/Powerdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can powerup/down your account with piston using:::

    piston powerup "100 GOLOS"
    piston powerdown "10000 GESTS"

If ``--author``/``--to`` are not provided, the *default* account as defined with
``piston set author`` will be taken.

To route your powerdows to another account automatically, you can use
``powerdownroute``. Read more in the corresponding help::

   piston powerdownroute -h

Convert
~~~~~~~

This method allows to convert SteemDollar to STEEM using the internal convertion
rate after 1 week. Note, that when you convert, you will obtain the
corresponding amount of STEEM only after waiting 1 week. ::

    piston convert --account <account>


Balances
~~~~~~~~

Get an account's balance with::

    piston balance <account>

If ``<account>`` is not provided, the *default* account will be taken.

Interest
~~~~~~~~

SteemDollar pay interest. You can see the details for any account using:::

    piston interest <account>

History
~~~~~~~

You can get an accounts history by using::

    piston history <account>

Furthermore you can filter by ``types`` and limit the result by
transaction numer. More information can be found by calling ``piston
history -h``.


Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Any account permission can be inspected using::

    piston permissions [<account>]

The take the following form::

    +------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Permission | Threshold |                                               Key/Account |
    +------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
    |      owner |         2 |                                                fabian (1) |
    |            |           | GLS7mgtsF5XPU9tokFpEz2zN9sQ89oAcRfcaSkZLsiqfWMtRDNKkc (1) |
    +------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
    |     active |         1 | GLS6quoHiVnmiDEXyz4fAsrNd28G6q7qBCitWbZGo4pTfQn8SwkzD (1) |
    +------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
    |    posting |         1 |                                             streemian (1) |
    |            |           | GLS6xpuUdyoRkRJ1GQmrHeNiVC3KGadjrBayo25HaTyBxBCQNwG3j (1) |
    |            |           | GLS8aJtoKdTsrRrWg3PB9XsbsCgZbVeDhQS3VUM1jkcXfVSjbv4T8 (1) |
    +------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

The permissions are either **owner** (full control over the account),
**active** (full control, except for changing the owner), and
**posting** (for posting and voting). The keys can either be a public
key or another account name while the number behind shows the weight of
the entry. If the weight is smaller than the threshold, a single
signature will not suffice to validate a transaction

Allow/Disallow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissions can be changed using:::

    piston allow --account <account> --weight 1 --permission posting --threshold 1 <foreign_account>
    piston disallow --permission <permissions> <foreign_account>

More details and the default parameters can be found via:::

    piston allow --help
    piston disallow --help

Update Memo Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The memo key of your account can be updated with

    piston updatememokey --key <KEY>

If no ``key`` is provided, it will ask for a password from which the
key will be derived

Create a new account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Piston let's you create new accounts on the Steem blockchain.

.. note:: 

    Creating new accounts will cost you a fee!

It works like this:

    piston newaccount <accountname>

and it will ask you to provide a new password. During creation, piston
will derive the new keys from the password (and the account name) and
store them in the wallet (except for the owner key)

.. note::

    ``newaccount`` will **not** store the owner private key in the
    wallet!

Import Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can import your existing account into piston by using

    piston importaccount --account <accountname>

It will ask you to provide the passphrase from which the private key
will be derived. If you already have a private key, you can use `addkey`
instead.

Sign/Broadcast Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unsigned (but properly prepared) transactions can be signed with
``sign``. Signed transactions can be broadcast using ``broadcast``.
These feature is described in :doc:`<coldstorage.rst>` and :doc:`<multisig.rst>`.
